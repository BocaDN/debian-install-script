### Install scripts for my Linux configs

Very much inspired by Typecraft's "Crucible": https://github.com/typecraft-dev/crucible

## Prerequisites

- A fresh Debian/Ubuntu Linux installation
- Internet connection
- sudo privileges

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BocaDN/debian-install-script.git; ./run.sh;
```

3. Follow the prompts to select the packages you want to install.

4. The script will handle the rest of the setup process.

5. After the setup is complete, you can reboot your system to see the changes.
